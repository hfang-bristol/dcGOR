## 1. R requirement

R (http://www.r-project.org) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. We assume R (version 3.1.0 or higher) has been installed in your local machine. The latest version can be installed following instructions below for different platforms (Windows, Mac, and Linux).

* Quick link for `Windows`: [Download R for Windows](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.1.2-win.exe).
* Quick link for `Mac`: [Download R for Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard or higher)](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).

* Below are `shell command lines in Terminal` (for `Linux`):

Assume you have a `ROOT (sudo)` privilege:
    
    sudo su
    wget http://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/src/base/R-3/R-3.1.2.tar.gz
    tar xvfz R-3.1.2.tar.gz
    cd R-3.1.2
    ./configure
    make
    make check
    make install
    R # start R

Assume you do not have a ROOT privilege and want R installation under your home directory (below `/home/hfang` should be replaced with yours):

    wget http://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/src/base/R-3/R-3.1.2.tar.gz
    tar xvfz R-3.1.2.tar.gz
    cd R-3.1.2
    ./configure --prefix=/home/hfang/R-3.1.2
    make
    make check
    make install
    /home/hfang/R-3.1.2/bin/R # start R

## 2. Installation of the package

Notes: below are `R command lines (NOT shell command lines in Terminal)`.

First, install dependant/imported/suggested packages:

    source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
    biocLite(c("hexbin","ape","supraHex","graph","Rgraphviz","igraph","foreach","doMC","dnet","devtools"))

Second, install the package `dcGOR` under [stable release version hosted in CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=dcGOR):

    install.packages("dcGOR",repos="http://cran.r-project.org",type="source")

Third (`highly recommended`), update the package `dcGOR` from [latest development version hosted in GitHub](https://github.com/hfang-bristol/dcGOR):

    library(devtools)
    for(pkg in c("dcGOR","dnet")){
        if(pkg %in% rownames(installed.packages())) remove.packages(pkg)
        install_github(repo=paste("hfang-bristol",pkg,sep="/"))
    }
