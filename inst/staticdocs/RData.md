## Introduction
As part of the package, the built-in RData (with `.RData` extension) contain curated/compiled data, which can be broadly grouped into the following categories:

* `Ontologies`

Ontologies include Gene Ontology (GO) and its three subontologies (BP: Biological Process; MF: Molecular Function; CC: Cellular Component), Human Phenotype (HP) and its three subontologies (PA: Phenotypic Abnormality; ON: ONset and clinical course; MI: Mode of Inheritance), Disease Ontology (DO), and Mammalian Phenotype (MP). Terms in an ontology are organised as a direct acyclic graph (DAG), which is further stored as an object of the class [igraph](http://igraph.org/r/doc/aaa-igraph-package.html).
