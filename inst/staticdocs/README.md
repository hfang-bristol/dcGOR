<B><h4>An open-source R package for analysing domain-centric ontologies and annotations</h4></B>

## Features

* New data structure storing ontologies (defined as an `igraph` class) and annotations (as an `Anno` class);
* A wide variety of organism-independent ontologies (eg `Gene Ontology`) and organism-specific ontologies (eg  `Disease Ontology` and `Human Phenotype` in human, `Mammalian Phenotype` in mouse, and many other phenotype/anatomy ontologies in well-studied organisms including chicken, c.elegans, fruitfly, zebrafish and arabidopsis), and their annotations on protein domains;
* Enrichment analysis using domain-centric ontologies and annotations;
* Semantic similarity between ontology terms (and between their annotated domains);
* Random Walk with Restart for network affinity calculation;
* Support for high-performance parallel computing;
* A tool with rich visuals but less inputs, which can run on `Windows`, `Mac` and `Linux`.
