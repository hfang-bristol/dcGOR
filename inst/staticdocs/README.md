<B><h4>An open-source R package for analysing domain-centric ontologies and annotations</h4></B>

## Features

* `Database`: R package for the [dcGO](http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/dcGO) database that provides domain-centric annotations by organism-independent ontologies (eg "Gene Ontology") and organism-specific ontologies (eg "Disease Ontology", "Human Phenotype", "Mammalian Phenotype", and many others in model organisms);
* `Infrastructure`: data structure storing ontologies (as an "igraph" class) and annotations (as an "Anno" class);
* `Enrichment analysis`: domain-based enrichment analysis using a wide variety of ontologies;
* `Semantic similarity`: domain-domain semantic similarity according to their annotations by an ontology;
* `Random Walk with Restart`: support for walk on domain semantic similarity network;
* `Parallel computing`: a huge save in computational runtime with parallel option.
