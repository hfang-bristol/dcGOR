CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.2
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES
    
    o Add S4 classes 'Coutput' and 'Cnetwork' to store RWR-based contact outputs and network
    
    o Fix several bugs
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.1
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES
    
    o Add an S4 class 'Onto' to store ontologies (instead of using 'igraph' previously)
    
    o Add an S4 class 'Eoutput' to store enrichment analysis outputs
    
    o Add an S4 class 'Dnetwork' to store domain networks (eg semantic similarity between domains)
    
    o Add S4 classes 'Coutput' and 'Cnetwork' to store RWR-based contact outputs and network

    o Add the function 'dcConverter' allowing for conversion between classes 'Onto' and 'igraph'
