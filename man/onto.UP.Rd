\title{UniProtKB UniPathway (UP).}

\usage{
onto.UP <- dcRDataLoader(RData='onto.UP')
}

\description{
An R object that contains information on UniProtKB UniPathway terms. These terms are organised as a direct acyclic graph (DAG), which is further stored as an object of the class 'igraph' (see \url{http://igraph.org/r/doc/aaa-igraph-package.html}). UniProtKB UniPathway (UP) is a fully manually curated resource for the representation and annotation of metabolic pathways, being used as a controlled vocabulary for pathway annotation in UniProtKB.
}

\value{
    an object of S4 class \link{Onto}. It has slots for "nodeInfo" and "adjMatrix"
    \itemize{
        \item{\code{nodeInfo}: an object of S4 class \link{InfoDataFrame}, describing information on nodes/terms including: "term_id" (i.e. Term ID), "term_name" (i.e. Term Name), "term_namespace" (i.e. Term Namespace), and "term_distance" (i.e. Term Distance: the distance to the root; always 0 for the root itself)}
        \item{\code{adjMatrix}: an object of S4 class \link{AdjData}, containing adjacency data matrix, with rows for parent (arrow-outbound) and columns for children (arrow-inbound)}
    }
