\title{Gene Ontology Cellular Component (GOCC).}

\usage{
data(onto.GOCC)
}

\description{
An R object that contains information on Gene Ontology Cellular Component terms. These terms are organised as a direct acyclic graph (DAG), which is further stored as an object of the class 'igraph' (see \url{http://igraph.org/r/doc/aaa-igraph-package.html}). This data is prepared based on \url{http://www.geneontology.org/ontology/obo_format_1_2/gene_ontology.1_2.obo}. Only the edges with the relation (either 'is_a' or 'part_of') are retained. 
}

\value{
    an object of S4 class \link{Onto}. It has slots for "nodeInfo" and "adjMatrix"
    \itemize{
        \item{\code{nodeInfo}: an object of S4 class \link{InfoDataFrame}, describing information on nodes/terms including: "term_id" (i.e. Term ID), "term_name" (i.e. Term Name), "term_namespace" (i.e. Term Namespace), and "term_distance" (i.e. Term Distance: the distance to the root; always 0 for the root itself)}
        \item{\code{adjMatrix}: an object of S4 class \link{AdjData}, containing adjacency data matrix, with rows for parent (arrow-outbound) and columns for children (arrow-inbound)}
    }
