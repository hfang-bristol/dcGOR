\title{Function to propogate ontology annotations according to an input file}
\usage{
dcAlgoPropagate(input.file, ontology = c("GOBP", "GOMF", "GOCC",
"HPPA",
"HPMI", "HPON"), output.file = "HIS.RData", verbose = T,
RData.location = "http://supfam.org/dcGOR/data")
}
\arguments{
\item{input.file}{an input file used to build the object. This input
file contains original annotations between domains/features and
ontology terms, along with the hypergeometric scores (hscore) in
support for their annotations. For example, a file containing original
annotations between SCOP domain architectures and GO terms can be found
in \url{http://supfam.org/dcGOR/data/Feature/Feature2GO.sf.txt}. As
seen in this example, the input file must contain the header (in the
first row) and three columns: 1st column for 'Feature_id' (here SCOP
domain architectures), 2nd column for 'Term_id' (GO terms), and 3rd
column for 'Score' (hscore)}

\item{ontology}{the ontology identity. It can be "GOBP" for Gene
Ontology Biological Process, "GOMF" for Gene Ontology Molecular
Function, "GOCC" for Gene Ontology Cellular Component, "DO" for Disease
Ontology, "HPPA" for Human Phenotype Phenotypic Abnormality, "HPMI" for
Human Phenotype Mode of Inheritance, "HPON" for Human Phenotype ONset
and clinical course}

\item{output.file}{an output file used to save the built object as an
RData-formatted file. If NULL, this file will be saved into "HIS.RData"
in the current working local directory}

\item{verbose}{logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to TRUE for display}

\item{RData.location}{the characters to tell the location of built-in
RData files. By default, it remotely locates at
"http://supfam.org/dcGOR/data" or
"https://github.com/hfang-bristol/dcGOR/data". For the user equipped
with fast internet connection, this option can be just left as default.
But it is always advisable to download these files locally. Especially
when the user needs to run this function many times, there is no need
to ask the function to remotely download every time (also it will
unnecessarily increase the runtime). For examples, these files (as a
whole or part of them) can be first downloaded into your current
working directory, and then set this option as:
\eqn{RData.location="."}. If RData to load is already part of package
itself, this parameter can be ignored (since this function will try to
load it via function \code{data} first)}
}
\value{
an object of S3 class \code{HIS}, with following components:
\itemize{
\item{\code{hscore}: a list of features, each with a term-named vector
containing hscore}
\item{\code{ic}: a term-named vector containing information content
(IC). Terms are ordered first by IC and then by longest-path level,
making sure that for terms with the same IC, parental terms always come
first}
\item{\code{slim}: a list of four slims, each with a term-named vector
containing information content (IC). Slim '1' for very general terms,
'2' for general terms, '3' for specific terms, '4' for very specific
terms}
}
}
\description{
\code{dcAlgoPropagate} is supposed to propogate ontology annotations,
given an input file. This input file contains original annotations
between domains/features and ontology terms, along with the
hypergeometric scores (hscore) in support for their annotations. The
annotations are propogated to the ontology root (retaining the maximum
hscore). After the propogation, the ontology terms of increasing levels
are determined based on the concept of Information Content (IC) to
product a slim version of ontology. It returns an object of S3 class
"HIS" with three components: "hscore", "ic" and "slim".
