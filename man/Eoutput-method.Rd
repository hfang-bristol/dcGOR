\usage{
\S4method{show}{Eoutput}(object)

\S4method{zscore}{Eoutput}(x)

\S4method{pvalue}{Eoutput}(x)

\S4method{adjp}{Eoutput}(x)

\S4method{view}{Eoutput}(x, top_num = 5, sortBy = c("pvalue", "adjp",
"zscore", "nAnno", "nOverlap", "none"), decreasing = NULL, details = T)

\S4method{write}{Eoutput}(x, file = "Eoutput.txt", verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of S4 class \code{Eoutput}. Usually this is an
output from \code{\link{dcEnrichment}}}

\item{x}{an object of S4 class \code{Eoutput}. Usually this is an
output from \code{\link{dcEnrichment}}}

\item{top_num}{the maximum number (5, by default) of terms will be
viewed. If NULL or NA, all terms will be viewed (this can be used for
the subsequent saving)}

\item{sortBy}{which statistics will be used for sorting and viewing
terms. It can be "pvalue" for p value, "adjp" for adjusted p value,
"zscore" for enrichment z-score, "nAnno" for the number in domains
annotated by a term, "nOverlap" for the number in overlaps, and "none"
for ordering simply according to ID of terms}

\item{decreasing}{logical to indicate whether to sort in a decreasing
order. If it is null, by default it will be true for "zscore", "nAnno"
or "nOverlap"; otherwise false}

\item{details}{logical to indicate whether the detailed information of
terms is also viewed. By default, it sets to TRUE for the inclusion}

\item{file}{a character specifying a file name written into. By
default, it is 'Eoutput.txt'}

\item{verbose}{logical to indicate whether the messages will be
displayed in the screen. By default, it sets to true for display}
}
\value{
view(x) returns a data frame with following components:
\itemize{
\item{\code{term_id}: term ID}
\item{\code{nAnno}: number in domains annotated by a term}
\item{\code{nGroup}: number in domains from the input group}
\item{\code{nOverlap}: number in overlaps}
\item{\code{zscore}: enrichment z-score}
\item{\code{pvalue}: p value}
\item{\code{adjp}: adjusted p value}
\item{\code{term_name}: term name}
\item{\code{term_namespace}: term namespace; optional, it is only
appended when "details" is true}
\item{\code{term_distance}: term distance; optional, it is only
appended when "details" is true}
\item{\code{members}: members (represented as domain IDs) in overlaps;
optional, it is only appended when "details" is true}
}
write(x) also returns the same data frame as view(x), in addition to a
specified local file.
