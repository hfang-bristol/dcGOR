\arguments{
\item{e}{an object of S4 class \code{\link{Eoutput}}}

\item{nodes_query}{a verctor containing a list of nodes/terms in query.
These nodes are used to produce a subgraph of the ontology DAG induced
by them. If NULL, the top significant terms (in terms of p-value) will
be determined by the next 'num_top_nodes'}

\item{num_top_nodes}{a numeric value specifying the number of the top
significant terms (in terms of p-value) will be used. This parameter
does not work if the previous 'nodes_query' has been specified}

\item{path.mode}{the mode of paths induced by nodes in query. It can be
"all_paths" for all possible paths to the root, "shortest_paths" for
only one path to the root (for each node in query),
"all_shortest_paths" for all shortest paths to the root (i.e. for each
node, find all shortest paths with the equal lengths)}

\item{data.type}{a character telling which data type for nodes in query
is used to color-code nodes. It can be one of 'adjp' for adjusted
p-values (by default), 'pvalue' for p-values and 'zscore' for z-scores.
When 'adjp' or 'pvalue' is used, 10-based negative logarithm is taken.
For the style of how to color-code, please see the next arguments:
colormap, ncolors, zlim and colorbar}

\item{height}{a numeric value specifying the height of device}

\item{width}{a numeric value specifying the width of device}

\item{margin}{margins as units of length 4 or 1}

\item{colormap}{short name for the colormap. It can be one of "yr"
(yellow-red colormap; by default), "jet" (jet colormap), "bwr"
(blue-white-red colormap), "gbr" (green-black-red colormap), "wyr"
(white-yellow-red colormap), "br" (black-red colormap), "wb"
(white-black colormap), and "rainbow" (rainbow colormap, that is,
red-yellow-green-cyan-blue-magenta). Alternatively, any
hyphen-separated HTML color names, e.g. "lightyellow-orange" (by
default), "blue-black-yellow", "royalblue-white-sandybrown",
"darkgreen-white-darkviolet". A list of standard color names can be
found in \url{http://html-color-codes.info/color-names}}

\item{ncolors}{the number of colors specified over the colormap}

\item{zlim}{the minimum and maximum z/data values for which colors
should be plotted, defaulting to the range of the finite values of z.
Each of the given colors will be used to color an equispaced interval
of this range. The midpoints of the intervals cover the range, so that
values just outside the range will be plotted}

\item{colorbar}{logical to indicate whether to append a colorbar. If
data is null, it always sets to false}

\item{colorbar.fraction}{the relative fraction of colorbar block
against the device size}

\item{newpage}{logical to indicate whether to open a new page. By
default, it sets to true for opening a new page}

\item{layout.orientation}{the orientation of the DAG layout. It can be
one of "left_right" for the left-right layout (viewed from the DAG root
point; by default), "top_bottom" for the top-bottom layout,
"bottom_top" for the bottom-top layout, and "right_left" for the
right-left layout}

\item{node.info}{tells the ontology term information used to label
nodes. It can be one of "both" for using both of Term ID and Name (the
first 15 characters; by default), "none" for no node labeling,
"term_id" for using Term ID, "term_name" for using Term Name (the first
15 characters), and "full_term_name" for using the full Term Name}

\item{graph.node.attrs}{a list of global node attributes. These node
attributes will be changed globally. See 'Note' below for details on
the attributes}

\item{graph.edge.attrs}{a list of global edge attributes. These edge
attributes will be changed globally. See 'Note' below for details on
the attributes}

\item{node.attrs}{a list of local edge attributes. These node
attributes will be changed locally; as such, for each attribute, the
input value must be a named vector (i.e. using Term ID as names). See
'Note' below for details on the attributes}
}
\value{
An object of class 'Ragraph'
}
\description{
\code{visEnrichment} is supposed to visualise enrichment analysis
outputs (represented as an 'Eoutput' object) in the context of the
ontology hierarchy (direct acyclic graph; DAG). Only part of DAG
induced by those nodes/terms specified in query nodes (and the mode
defining the paths to the root of DAG) will be visualised. Nodes in
query are framed in black (by default), and all nodes (in query plus
induced) will be color-coded according to a given data.type ('zscore';
otherwise taking the form of 10-based negative logarithm for 'adjp' or
'pvalue'). If no nodes in query, the top 5 significant terms (in terms
of adjusted p-value) will be used for visualisation
}

\itemize{
\item{"shape": the shape of the node: "circle", "rectangle", "rect",
