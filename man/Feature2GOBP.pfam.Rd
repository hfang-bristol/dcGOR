\usage{
Feature2GOBP.pfam <- dcRDataLoader(RData='Feature2GOBP.pfam')
}

\description{
An object of class "HIS" that contains annotations and scores between Gene Ontology Biological Process terms and Pfam domains/combinations. This data is prepared based on the dcGO database (see \url{http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/dcGO/}).
}

\value{   
    an object of class \code{HIS}. It has three components for "hscore", "ic" and "slim": 
    \itemize{
        \item{\code{hscore}: a list of domain-related features, each with a term-named vector containing hypergeometric score (hscore)}
        \item{\code{ic}: a term-named vector containing information content (IC). Terms are ordered first by IC and then by longest-path level, making sure that for terms with the same IC, parental terms always come first}
        \item{\code{slim}: a list of four slims, each with a term-named vector containing information content (IC). Slim '1' for very general terms, '2' for general terms, '3' for specific terms, '4' for very specific terms}
    }
