Description: The package is used to analyse domain-centric ontologies and annotations, particularly those in the dcGO database. The dcGO (http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/dcGO) is a comprehensive domain-centric database for annotating protein domains using a panel of ontologies including Gene Ontology. With the package, users are expected to analyse and visualise domain-centric ontologies and annotations. Supported analyses include but are not limited to: easy access to a wide range of ontologies and their domain-centric annotations; able to build customised ontologies and annotations; domain-based enrichment analysis and visualisation; construction of a domain (semantic similarity) network according to ontology annotations; significance analysis for estimating a contact (statistical significance) network via Random Walk with Restart; and high-performance parallel computing. The under-development functionality is: 1) to predict ontology terms for input protein sequences, precisely domain content in the form of architectures; 2) to reconstruct ancestral discrete characters using maximum likelihood/parsimony.
