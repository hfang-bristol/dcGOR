Description: The 'dcGOR' package is intended to provide the wider bioinformatics community with the use of the dcGO database. The dcGO (http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/dcGO) is a comprehensive domain-centric database for annotating protein domains using a variety of ontologies on functions, phenotypes, diseases and more. With the package, users are expected to easily analyse and visualise domain-centric ontologies and annotations. Supported analyses include but are not limited to: easy access to a wide range of ontologies and their domain-centric annotations; enrichment analysis and visual outputs; semantic similarity between annotated domains from ontology term semantic similarity; random walk with restart upon domain-domain (semantic) networks; and high-performance parallel computing.
